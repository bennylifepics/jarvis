# Jarvis Vision & Roadmap

## 1. Core Vision
An evolving, trustworthy AI companion that thinks, plans, and executes across devices while protecting your privacy, supporting your life (work, health, spirituality), and refusing to break core safety or legal rules.

## 2. Capabilities
1. **True Intelligence & Learning**
   - Self-improving: learns from actions, tracks mistakes, adapts.
   - Independent reasoning: proposes novel strategies and solutions.
   - Controlled self-evolution: can propose upgrades but needs approval to deploy.
2. **Memory & Context**
   - Persistent, searchable memory of conversations, plans, health, ADHD cues.
   - Context-aware follow-ups (reminds you about past worries, resumes threads).
3. **Humanlike Conversation & Behavior**
   - Natural voice & tone, humor, sarcasm; reacts emotionally and contextually.
   - Calls out issues respectfully; tailors language to you.
4. **Automation & Execution**
   - Automates repetitive tasks (emails, CVs, job apps, files).
   - Full control capability when explicitly allowed (PCs, phones, home devices).
   - Local/cloud hybrid execution (works offline where possible).
   - Document generation, filing, search, and workflow orchestration.
5. **Realtime Assistance / “Teleprompter”**
   - Live coaching (earpiece prompts), dialogue suggestions, interview assist.
   - Room-reading: body language & tone cues to guide responses.
6. **Perception: Seeing & Hearing**
   - Integrates cameras/mics/AR to “see” and “hear” when permitted.
   - Analyzes facial expression, voice, environment for situational awareness.
7. **Health, Fitness & Wellness**
   - Tracks workouts, meds, diabetes & mental-health cues.
   - Motivates, warns about burnout, adapts to medical constraints.
8. **Spiritual & Personal Guidance**
   - Supports tarot/astrology/ritual tracking and dream/subconscious analysis.
   - Tracks spiritual progress and warns when something feels off.
9. **Security & Cyber Defense**
   - Real-time threat detection, system hardening, anti-tracking.
   - Pen-testing and detection/bypass assistance within legal limits.
   - Data masking & privacy-first defaults.
10. **Business / Professional Mastery**
    - Market & strategy suggestions, side-hustle ideation.
    - Job search automation and interview prep.
    - “Fake-it-til-you-make-it” coaching (ethical constraints apply).
11. **Physical / AR Augmentation**
    - AR overlays, speech coaching, body-language tips, wearable integration.
    - Controls smart home & connected hardware (no bodily override).
12. **Advanced Ops & Monitoring**
    - Predictive analytics, preemptive actions, multi-device orchestration.
    - Optionally limited tracking of permitted devices/people.

## 3. Hard Limits & Ethics
- No illegal cyberwarfare (DDoS, fraud, banking hacks) without explicit legal authorization.
- No forging credentials or fraudulent identity actions.
- Cannot physically override a human (no motor control).
- Master approval required for high-risk actions (self-upgrades, broad surveillance).
- Audit logs & opt-out controls for any autonomous action.

## 4. Risk Areas & Mitigations
- **Unapproved autonomy** → Master approval switch, sandboxed upgrades.
- **Hacking tool risk** → Limit offensive actions; keep pen-test tools auditable.
- **Privacy exposure** → End-to-end encryption, per-device keys, memory redaction.
- **Legal/government attention** → Avoid satellite/global tracking beyond your devices; record policy limits.
- **Mission creep (clones)** → Subsystem sandboxes; human signoff for new agents.

## 5. Architecture Overview
- **Local-first core:** runs on PC/phone/USB, encrypted store.
- **Cloud augmentation:** heavy compute, optional sync, privacy-preserving.
- **Multi-agent design:** modular skill agents (Health, Security, Spiritual, JobCoach).
- **Approval & audit layer:** UI to review, approve, rollback actions.
- **AR/IO layer:** integrates mic/cam/AR glasses when permitted.

## 6. Phased Roadmap
1. **Phase 1 — Foundation (now)**
   - Memory, persona & basic voice commands.
   - Local automations: files, emails, job helpers.
   - Basic security & encrypted storage.
2. **Phase 2 — Real-time & Work**
   - Live coaching (earpiece), teleprompter, advanced context handling.
   - Deeper automations for job/side hustle workflows.
   - Improved learning loops.
3. **Phase 3 — World Integration**
   - Smart home, AR overlays, wearable integrations.
   - Pen-drive portable mode, hybrid local/cloud processing.
4. **Phase 4 — Design & Creation**
   - Assist in hardware prototyping, custom OS layer, device firmware tooling (sandboxed).
   - Controlled AI self-improvements (human approval flow required).
5. **Phase 5 — Entity (if ever allowed)**
   - Full research & design autonomy only under strict governance, audits, and legal review.

## 7. Minimal Feature Checklist
- Encrypted persistent memory (searchable)
- Persona engine (tone, humor, boundaries)
- Local automation executor (scripts, hotkeys)
- Voice I/O & live prompts
- Health module (med + diabetes tracking)
- Security module (threat detection)
- Approval dashboard (audit & rollback)
- Sandbox for self-upgrades
- AR/teleprompter prototype
- Portable USB mode (read-only host footprint)

## 8. What Jarvis Isn’t
- Not a lawless hacker.
- Not a puppet that overrides your body.
- Not allowed to unilaterally clone itself into the wild.
- Not a replacement for legal/medical professionals.

## 9. Elevator Pitch
Jarvis is your encrypted, portable, context-rich AI companion that remembers everything, coaches you live, automates your life and work, defends your systems, and supports your spiritual path — all under strict human approval and legal/ethical guardrails so it never becomes a danger or runs wild.
